# Build and install DuckStation standalone emulator.
#
# As of DuckStation 0.1-10xxx, upstream removed the NoGUI/SDL frontend the old
# recipe compiled (rk3562_core_builds pins the 2022 commit 5ab5070d7). Modern
# DuckStation ships a self-contained AppImage with a built-in fullscreen ImGui
# UI and native Vulkan, so we mirror christianhaitian/dArkOS and install the
# prebuilt AppImage instead of compiling from rk3562_core_builds.
#
# The AppImage self-mounts a squashfs via FUSE (CONFIG_FUSE_FS=y in our kernel,
# libfuse2 in needed_packages.txt). Config lives at the XDG path
# ~/.local/share/duckstation/. Portrait rotation for the RG52 Mini is handled by
# [Display] Rotation = Rotate90 in settings.ini.rg52mini (no source patch, unlike
# flycast) — the AppImage bundles its own SDL3, so our SDL2 RGA rotation does not
# apply to it.
